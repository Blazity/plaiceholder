## Setup

In this example, we're going to create a [BlurHash][blurhash] string for a single image inside a Next.js [Page](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages).

We'll then use [`react-blurhash`][react-blurhash] to render the string to a canvas, to sit underneath our [`Image`][next/image] whilst it's loading.

> [**See the demo**][demo] for a live example.

1. Add the package to your existing Next.js project:

   ```sh
   npm i next-blurhash react-blurhash
   ```

2. Add your chosen image to the [`public`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/static-file-serving) directory.

   In this case, our image is `public/keila-joa.jpg` (to match the [demo][demo])

   > In it's current state, `next-blurhash` only supports [local images](#what-about-remote-images).

3. Create a new page (or add to an existing page), and add the following:

   1. Call `getStaticBlurhash()` inside `getStaticProps()` with your image's path **without the `public` prefix**.

      This will return the [BlurHash][blurhash] string as a static prop (which will be decoded to dimensions of **32√ó32**).

   2. Import `BlurhashCanvas` from [`react-blurhash`][react-blurhash] and supply it with your newly generated static [BlurHash][blurhash] string.

   3. Add custom styles to place the `BlurhashCanvas` underneath Next.js' `Image` whilst it loads.

   ```jsx
   // pages/index.jsx
   import * as React from "react";
   import Image from "next/image";
   import { getStaticBlurhash } from "next-blurhash";
   import { BlurhashCanvas } from "react-blurhash";

   export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps = async () => {
     const imgSrc = "/keila-joa.jpg";
     const imgHash = await getStaticBlurhash(imgSrc);

     return {
       props: {
         imgHash,
         imgSrc,
       },
     };
   };

   function Index({ imgHash, imgSrc }) {
     return (
       <main>
         <div style={{ position: "relative" }}>
           {/* Canvas sits underneath the `Image` and fills available space */}
           <BlurhashCanvas
             // Your generated Blurhash string
             hash={imgHash}
             // getStaticBlurhash **always** returns 32√ó32 dimensions
             width={32}
             height={32}
             punch={1}
             style={{
               position: "absolute",
               top: 0,
               left: 0,
               right: 0,
               bottom: 0,
               width: "100%",
               height: "100%",
             }}
           />
           {/* Your image, optimized by next/image */}
           <Image src={imgSrc} width={4032} height={3024} />
         </div>
       </main>
     );
   }

   export default Index;
   ```

4. [Run your Next.js app](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/cli#build) to see the results in action!

   You should expect to see the [BlurHash][blurhash] canvas first, then the image optimized by Next.js

### What about remote images?

In it's current state, `next-blurhash` only supports local images (added to `public`). PRs to add support for remote images are welcomed ‚ù§Ô∏è.
