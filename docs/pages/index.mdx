"Plaiceholder" is a collection of **Node.js** helpers for creating low quality image placeholders, with 4 approaches to choose from:

1.  [**CSS**](#css) <small>(recommended)</small>
2.  [**SVG**](#svg)
3.  [**Base64**](#base64)
4.  [**Blurhash**](#blurhash)

  Disclaimer: It's worth taking pros/cons of each approach with a grain of salt.
  Although initial tests locally and on [WebPageTest](webpagetest.org/) have
  proved successful, extra research needs to be completed to determine the
  fastest solution.
