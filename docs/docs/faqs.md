# FAQs

## Why have you misspelled "placeholder"?

A [Plaice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_plaice) is a flat fish that lays stationary on the sea-bed, much like an image placehol… actually this is bullshit, all the other good names were taken.

## What about remote images in Tailwind?

In it's current state, `@plaiceholder/tailwindcss` only supports local images (added to `public`). PRs to add support for remote images are welcomed ❤️.
