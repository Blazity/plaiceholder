"Plaiceholder" is a collection of **Node.js** helpers for creating low quality image placeholders, with several approaches to choose from:

1.  [**CSS**](/strategies#css) <small>(recommended)</small>
2.  [**SVG**](/strategies#svg)
3.  [**Base64**](/strategies#base64)
4.  [**Blurhash**](/strategies#blurhash)

:::note

Disclaimer: It's worth taking pros/cons of each approach with a grain of salt.  
Although initial tests locally and on [WebPageTest](https://webpagetest.org/) have proved successful, extra research needs to be completed to determine the fastest solution.
